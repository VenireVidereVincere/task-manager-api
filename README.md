# task-manager-api
This is a personal project where I learned how to handle authentication in the backend by developing an API for a task management app.

This integrates MongoDB, Node and Express, generating the endpoints necessary for someone to send HTTP requests through. 

Tests for each endpoint were generated using Jest. 

Will implement a frontend for it once I have gotten into React in order to complete the MERN stack. 

For the time being, you can access the API for you to send HTTP requests (via a service such as Postman) through the following link:
